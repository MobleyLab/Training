# Computing and coding

## Helpful resources

### Linux, command-line, Python etc.:
- For very helpful material on Linux and Python relevant to our area, refer to [Oliver Beckstein's Computational Methods in Physics course](https://asu-compmethodsphysics-phy494.github.io/ASU-PHY494/overview/), which has sectionns on Linux/Unix, Python, git, etc.
- For additional background information on Linux, check out [Code Academy's course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).
- MIT has a nice course, [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) which covers the shell, shell tools/scripting, editors, data, command-line, version control, debugging and profiling, security and cryptography, and a variety of other topics.
- [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ssh++-Fc+-N+-f+hs) provides a place where you can type in Linux shell commands and it will explain them to you

### Trainings relating to computer-aided drug design with Python
- [My course in Computing Techniques in Drug Discovery](https://github.com/MobleyLab/drug-computing)

### Numerical methods and error analysis
- [Andrew White's Numerical Methods and Statistics](https://whitead.github.io/numerical_stats/)
- [Best Practices for Quantification of Uncertainty and Sampling Quality in Molecular Simulations](https://www.livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e5067)

### Deep learning/machine learning
