# Navigating the Peer Review System

*By David Mobley*

The authoring/peer review process tends to seem opaque and stressful, especially for early-career scientists. It doesn't have to be, however. Here I'll give a very brief overview of how I like to see the paper preparation, submission, and review process working, then focus especially on my strategy for dealing with and responding to peer reviews.

## The life cycle of a paper

In the lab, I typically like to see papers proceed through several stages:
1. **Early concept and outline**: When starting a project, ideally one would develop the concept and begin an initial outline which deals with the purpose of the study and what its objectives are, as well as what exactly needs to be done to accomplish that.
2. **Mid-stage outline**: As the study goes on, the outline gets updated to reflect what is actually being done and how the study is developing, as well as information on critical graphics/figures/tables/analysis.
3. **Late-stage outline**: Eventually, as the study concludes, the outline reaches a point where it is detailed enough that it shows the major structure of the paper, drafts/sketches of the figures and tables which will be made (these don't have to be publication quality; the point here is to plan out what they will be like before you waste time making publication-quality ones), and goes over all the main points without worrying about proper English and grammar. The points can be made in bullet-point form, but at a detailed enough level that they could easily be turned into prose. The outline will likely include info on most sources to be cited. At this point, we also edit the *structure* of the paper before doing the actual drafting, so that the process of organizing the paper can occur before we write it -- saving much editing in the later stages.
4. **First (rough) draft**: The outline is then turned into a first draft, usually by the first author (though see below), essentially by converting the outline into prose and inserting figures, tables, and data. Depending on the paper, the next step(s) will vary; it may be be circulated to all authors, or it may go through one or more rounds of editing with group members/the PI before it is circulated further, or the author may edit more individually before that.
5. **Later draft(s)**: The author may then proceed to polish this draft further before circulating it, or it may be circulated at the rough draft stage. Eventually, though, the PI and all authors will then edit this first draft, providing feedback, edits, etc. How many drafts this goes through will depend on many factors. One piece of practical advice is to always provide (or ask for) a timeline when asking for feedback.
6. **Final draft**: When the paper is finalized, it should be circulated to all authors for final approval, again with a set timeline.
7. **Preprint**: Once the paper is finalized and prior to submission, it should be submitted to a preprint server like bioRxiv, chemRxiv, arXiv, etc. (If it is a review or other content which cannot be posted to a traditional preprint server, consider Zenodo.) Choose permissive licensing, like CC-BY 4.0 (as discussed in the work of [Stodden](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1109/MCSE.2009.19)) to allow broad reuse of the content and to ensure at least SOME version of your paper is freely available. **Preprint submission is the stage we celebrate in the group** because it means you completed the paper we wanted to write, and submission is the step we control, whereas the peer review process can be more unpredictable.
8. **Peer review**: Once preprinted, we submit the paper to a journal for peer review. First, an editor will decide whether the paper appears of interest to that journal's audience and *potentially* of high enough quality to be appropriate for the journal. If so, the editor will send it out for review to usually two or more scientists in the field (though on occasion I've received as many as six peer reviews, or as few as one). These scientists will provide feedback/suggestions/criticism, usually one to two months after initial submission, and then the editor will make a decision. Decisions range from "reject" to "accept with no revisions", though rejections are rare if one is submitting solid work to an appropriate journal (and are more common the "higher impact" the journal is). Typically, solid work submitted to an appropriate journal will have a decision of "minor revisions" or "major revisions", the details of which vary widely. The end result can range from having to clarify a few points, to needing to substantially extend the whole study or re-do almost all of it. Ideally, one would have received enough feedback from colleagues early in the study design to avoid scenarios which involve re-doing substantial work. Once feedback is dealt with (more on this below) the changes and responses go back to the editor, who makes a decision on whether the changes are adequate, or whether another round of peer-review is needed. This process iterates until the editor reaches a final decision, though authors who manage the initial peer reviews well can usually reach acceptance after a single round of revisions.
9. **Publication**: Once the editor is happy with the results of the peer review process, the paper is accepted, then goes off for the journal's editing and typesetting process. If there are issues at this point, the journal may ask for minor adjustments (figure size changes, etc.), otherwise the authors will eventually get back a set of proofs to check for errors/problems before final publication. The intent is that the authors check for errors introduced in the editing/typesetting process, but this also provides an opportunity to do a last check for typos/unclear points, though extensive editing cannot be done.
10. **Post-publication**: Obviously, post-publication, one can promote the work, but there isn't much else to be done. Any changes would require an erratum (except with "special" journals like F1000 Research, or LiveCoMS). For this reason, I highly encourage authors to provide supporting data in a GitHub repository or similar, since any corrections needed to supporting data would otherwise require an erratum, even if they did not affect the paper itself.

### The process varies paper-to-paper

It is important to note that the first stage above, "early concept and outline", is highly variable from project-to-project. Some projects can be planned well from start-to-finish even before they are begun; others are more of an exploration and the destination is unclear until well after the study is underway. Thus the degree of planning which can be done is highly variable depending on the nature of the project.

### Help with paper writing

Many of us encounter writer's block, where we reach some stage of the process where it is difficult to proceed or where we are prone to procrastinate. You'll know you've hit this stage if you suddenly find you have a desperate desire to clean your house, cook, or do something else you normally don't like to do, when you otherwise had planned to be writing your paper. If that's the case, you either need some accountability or some help to continue onwards.

One thing that sometimes works well, especially for first-time authors, is to schedule a collaborative writing block -- either to finalize an outline, or to write a first draft. In this scenario, the author schedules a substantial block of time with the PI (or, possibly, another author). For example, I've blocked out six hours before to sit down together and write a first draft with a student or postdoc. Usually, one would dictate and the other would write, with questions going back and forth, etc. This can lead to a really great feeling -- you enter in the morning with nothing but a roadblock in your way, and you leave the session in the afternoon with most of a rough draft, along with notes on how to proceed from there.

That's a relatively extreme intervention, but accountability can also be helpful. Maybe you're able to make progress, but those procrastination reflexes keep getting in your way and you just aren't progressing as fast as you would like. Well, get a partner to hold you accountable to put in solid blocks of work on the paper (e.g. touch bases with a lab-mate once an hour or once a day on what you accomplished). There are even sites which can provide a virtual partner for you if non one is available.

### Don't overly stress about typesetting and formatting

You don't need to stress too much about how well your final draft conforms to what papers look like in the journal you're targeting. Yes, you need to adhere to the journal's guidelines regarding font sizes, and any rules it sets about section titles, etc. (so be sure to consult the author guidelines). But first and foremost, you're writing a paper. Ideally, you should produce a draft which looks nice, since you will post a preprint of it for everyone to read. Get help from the lab in choosing a nice LaTeX template for this purpose.

Given that you have a nice template, though, don't stress too much about formatting, typesetting, or the placement of your figures. LaTeX is famously bad at putting figures exactly where you want them, and the journal will ultimately change all of this when it prepares your paper for publication. Indeed, it takes your submitted material and completely reformats the entire article, placing the figures where it wants them, etc. None of your formatting will persist. So the important things for you to worry about are (a) making sure your preprint looks good and is easy to read and understand, and (b) making sure your peer reviewers can easily read, understand, and review the paper. You don't have to worry about making it match the way it should look in the journal.

## Practical writing tips

I have a few practical tips for writing to ensure productivity:
1. **Do one task at a time**: Whenever you are seriously writing, focus on one part of the writing process. Write, find references, do background reading, or compile data or figures. Don't jump around between tasks. Resist the temptation to write a couple of sentences, then realize you need a citation on a particular topic, then go off to investigate the literature to find the best citations on that. By the time you return, potentially a couple of hours later, you will have lost your train of thought and the ability to follow the logical flow of your writing. Instead, when you're writing, **just write**. As you go, make notes on the other things you think of that you need to do, so you can come back to them later. I like to put these in square brackets, with whatever I'm thinking of, like `[insert reference to Boresch paper here]` or `[add Figure of binding site here]` and then keep going. Later, come back and take action on any notes you've left for yourself. I'll take action on references in one time slot, work on figures in another, etc.
2. **Don't multitask**: Writing well requires focus. Resist the temptation to do other things or allow interruptions while you are writing. Set periods of time for writing during which you turn off all non-emergency notifications (or maybe even your internet and phone). Build in times to emerge and check if there's anything you need to deal with. Often, a time-based technique works well for this, though if you're working from an outline you could also do it by sections, e.g. "I'll write the first half of the bullet points in the Introduction and then take a break." I typically will work in something like 50 minute blocks with 10-minute procrastination/notifications breaks, something like a modified [pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). Find what works for you -- but most importantly, don't let notifications keep interrupting you. When it's time to write, write.

## Writing style guide

I plan to update this later to link to the lab style guide once I have it available on this repository.

## Dealing with peer reviews

When peer reviews come back, it's necessary to think through how to respond to them. Reviewers are often rushed, so it's not uncommon that they misunderstand parts of your paper, or even misunderstand the purpose entirely. It's easy to end up seeing the process, then, as a battle between you and the reviewers -- one where you have to fight them to ensure your paper gets a fair treatment.

I prefer, instead, to try and see peer reviewers as representative readers. If a peer reviewer has a question or misunderstands a point, it usually means that other readers will also misunderstand the same point, or have the same question -- even if the reviewer was completely incorrect.

To help understand the process, let's take a quick look at what the peer-review process looks like from the editor's side. As an author, you'll be able to navigate the process better if you understand what it looks like for the one making the decisions.

### Make the editor's job easy while improving your paper

When I'm serving as the editor of a paper, I may not be reading it as carefully as the peer reviewers. Often, I'll send it to several people who are more expert on the subject matter than I am, and whose judgment I trust. When I get the reviews back, I look at them carefully and then pass the decision on to the authors. When I get revisions back, I then look over the response letter to see how well the authors have addressed the reviewers' concerns. Particularly, I'm looking to see:
- Did they make the recommended changes?
- Are they getting into an argument with the reviewers or saying the reviewers are wrong?
- Did the reviewers raise any concerns about fundamental flaws and have those been fixed?
- Have the authors added any necessarily disclaimers on potential pitfalls, limitations, etc.?

If the authors have clearly taken seriously all of the concerns raised by reviewers, even if some of those resulted from a misunderstanding of certain points, they often can make my decision easy. If they've clearly made all of the recommended changes, it may not be necessary for me to send it back to the reviewers again. In contrast, if they're arguing with the reviewers or there's back-and-forth on issues that go deeper than my understanding, it will need to go back to the reviewers so I can get expert judgment on the topic.

Given that, authors can make the editor's job easy by making all the recommended changes that they possibly can, with the obvious exception of those which would hurt the paper or which are clearly misguided. Making these changes -- or clarifying any misunderstandings which led to them -- should make your paper stronger. This is particularly true if your reviewers are representative readers; you want to ensure that everyone else reading the paper doesn't have the same concerns as the reviewers, either by answering those concerns adequately in your paper, or clarifying any misunderstandings which led to them.

If your response, then, makes clear that you've taken seriously all of the reviewer comments and made appropriate changes to deal with them, you will normally tend to have a relatively easy time navigating the peer-review process, and your papers will get sent out for fewer cycles of re-review.

### Here's the procedure I prefer

Given the above, here's how I normally want peer reviews dealt with in the lab:
1. When reviews come in, create a Google Doc with the content of the peer reviews.
2. Below each major point of feedback, draft a response to the point (using a different font style). Explain (in past tense) what changes you want to say you made to the paper to address the concerns raised. For example, you could say, "We addressed this deficiency by performing the recommended calculations. The new data is shown in Table X and Figure Y..." or, "We apologize that we did not explain this point adequately; the reviewer thought we meant that X, but instead we were saying Y. We now make this point more clear in the revised manuscript." DO NOT YET MAKE ANY OF THESE CHANGES. Just make sure you understand the reviewer's concerns, and begin thinking through how they can be dealt with. Insert marginal comments in your Google Doc to note any concerns that you don't understand, or any points you aren't sure how to answer.
3. Take particular note of any points that would require new calculations or experiments, and prioritize those for decisions.
4. Make an effort to say "no" as little as possible; in the vast majority of cases, if the reviewer asks for something, you should either be revising the paper to provide that, or addressing *in the paper* why you don't need to do that. Then, your response to the reviewer can be something like, "We apologize for being unclear on this point; we have now added a section to the manuscript discussing this," or "We have updated the paper to more thoroughly discuss the prior data that indicates that X is a potentially viable approach, though we now note in the paper that Y may be a good follow-up experiment for future work." Again, your goal is to be able to show the reviewers and editor that you did the best job you possibly could to deal with every concern, even if you didn't do exactly what was recommended.
5. Iterate on the Google Doc with your PI and any co-authors to finalize your approach to dealing with the reviews.
6. Before making any changes to your paper, save a version
7. Do any necessary calculations and revisions
8. Add a small cover letter at the top of your Google Doc that explains that you believe you've adequately dealt with the concerns of the reviewers, and that detailed changes are given in the list of responses shown below.
9. (Optional/journal-dependent) Use `latexdiff` to prepare a version of your paper that shows all changes/edits highlighted. Submit this along with your paper.

## Data archival

More on this later, but briefly, you should try to ensure that your paper has everything needed to reproduce your work. This means providing a good description of what you actually did in the paper itself, as well as in associated Supporting Information. But you'll also want to provide code and input files, as well as potentially output data. Here's what I suggest:
- Small datasets and code should live in a GitHub repository. For paper-specific content, use a paper-specific GitHub repo; for general/multipurpose software, you may have a more general/sustainable repository. Make sure your paper clearly indicates what version of the software was used.
- Large datasets should be archived somewhere permanent, not dependent on your particular lab. Zenodo and Figshare can be good options, but other options can also be good; often, consulting your institutions library can provide good leads. At UCI, eScholarship can be a good option. Dryad can also be interesting.
- Consider multiple archival strategies for longevity:
  - Libraries and journals are probably best for long-term archival (e.g. in the long-term, GitHub may no longer exist)
  - For files that you might need to update or correct, make sure you use something version controlled like GitHub
- Usually I recommend making your content available on GitHub (except datasets which are too large and need to live elsewhere), and then linking to that GitHub repository in your paper, as well as archiving a *copy* of it with the journal. Note in your paper that any updates to the supporting materials will be made *on the GitHub repository*. Otherwise, any changes to your datasets will require an erratum to the paper, even if your changes don't affect the analysis/statistics/etc. in the paper. Obviously, that can rapidly become a nightmare -- for example, suppose your supporting data includes a list of molecules and some of the molecule names are incorrect. You don't want to do a new erratum anytime you someone points out an error in a molecule name.
