## Potentially helpful tips:
- Start by writing an outline
    - Use the group outline template, to be made available here at a later date
    - Begin by identifying the objective(s) of your paper -- what will it attempt to do/show/communicate and why? This dictates a lot about the outline
    - Identify a target journal or journals as this also affects the structure significantly
    - Then write a high level outline of the major sections -- what are the section titles and what major points will you make in each?
    - Usually save outlining -- and writing! -- the introduction and conclusions until the end, as these are often hardest
    - Eventually get down to a detailed outline, with at least a bullet point per paragraph and probably a bullet point per sentence before it is done
    - You will also want to (ultimately) identify all of the figures you’ll have, what data they’ll show, etc. Sketch your figures if needed and get feedback (or do quick draft figures), so you don’t waste time making and refining figures no one will want
    - Your outline can also list many of the references you’ll have
    - **Why write an outline first?**:
        - Separate the process of “picking the right words” from the process of “deciding how the paper should be organized”, and make it so that once you start to write, you only have to pick the right words
        - Deal with organizational issues (such as “this part belongs in the introduction") with your PI and other authors before you write the paper, to minimize the amount of rewriting you have to do
        - Writing an outline first helps you separate the hard process of thinking about what to say from the hard part of thinking about what words to use. Separating these parts makes it easier. (Scott Shell points out that a typical paper is about 7000 words; if you write for four hours a day for two weeks that's an average of 150 words per hour or 2.3 words per minute, which is nothing compared to writing a paper in a night for a college class. Thus it should never take multiple months to write a draft, unless you're wasting a lot of time somewhere -- and if you are, let's figure out where and why.)
- Make sure you’ve read Plaxco’s work on “the art of writing science”, and if you follow just one rule from it, make it be the “the first sentence of every paragraph states the point of the paragraph” rule (see here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3009394/)
- Know who is taking the lead role on the paper, and, if it’s you, know what that involves (e.g. see https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006508&type=printable )

## Tips for the writing process
- Identify what task you are working on at present and do **only that task**
  - If you're writing, don't get derailed by needing to fill in references. I like to write `[ref]` or `[ref Boresch paper]` or similar as I'm going to leave notes to myself that are easy to return to later.
    - Focus on **getting your ideas down** when it is time to write
    - Not on editing
    - You want to keep your train of thought going as you write, remembering where you came from and where you're going. So don't let anything interrupt that
    - **Turn off notifications**. Write for designated blocks of time interruption free.
  - If you're filling in references, focus on filling in references; don't go off onto a deep dive into the literature
  - Do a deep dive into the literature when it's time for that
- Build in procrastination breaks.
  - Likely you will only be able to maintain focus for a certain amount of time
  - Learn how long that is and then build in breaks for a designated amount of time to refresh/recover
  - Something like the Pomodoro technique can work well for this
  - Unless you are superhuman, you likely will not be able to stay deeply focused exlusively on writing for hours at a time; if you try to, you'll end up surfing the web or cleaning your house or...
  - Plan for this; learn what your limits are and make your work blocks smaller than those limits
- Identify if you have writers block and get help.
  - If it's hard to get going -- either on an outline or through a paper itself -- get help
    - I (Mobley) find that it sometimes helps first-time paper-writers if we block out an extended period of time sit down together and collaboratively write a first draft, either of an outline or a paper
    - If you need this, or think it might help, let's talk
    - It can be very satisfying to enter the room for an extended writing session, sit down together for a few hours, and leave with a draft that is complete enough to be able to continue fleshing it out on your own
    - This can require significant advance planning (e.g. I might not have a big block of time except on a weekend or if we plan far ahead)
    - Others could also help

- [Helmut Grubmuller's writing guidelines](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/631838/guidelines_english.pdf): These give a variety of useful and important tips on one of the key parts of writing and editing -- how to think about what the READER is thinking based on what you wrote. It's not just an issue of checking whether our words accurately represent what is in our heads -- but whether they get the reader to understand what we want them to understand. This also gives a variety of very concrete ways to improve scientific writing.
