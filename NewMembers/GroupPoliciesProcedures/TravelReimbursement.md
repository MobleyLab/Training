Philosophy: In general we try and act like a business, meaning that work-related travel should be reimbursed as long as you get permission in advance and expenses are reasonable.

Note also that our funding is typically not in separate buckets of "travel" vs "other stuff" so money which is not spent on travel can often be spent on paying people, or computer time, or whatever else, so we try and travel reasonably frugally.
