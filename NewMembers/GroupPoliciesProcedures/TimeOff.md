# Mobley Lab Policy on Time Off

Folks working in the lab are expected to take time off/away from work in order to be healthy (in body and mind), sharp, connected with their families and communities, and therefore productive in the lab. Too much time focused on research can result in you getting burned out, discouraged, and disconnected from the people around you.

Please plan on taking a minimum of two weeks off each year (if you are not in a position which accumulates leave; if you are, then use your leave), not counting holidays, weekends, etc. Deadlines, or your own priorities, may at times result in you deciding to put in time on holidays, weekends or similar, but if you do, you should as a general rule plan to be off at some other time to make up for it.  This 10 days does not count time off for being sick or out for medical appointments, etc., and represents a minimum. (As a postdoc, I worked with someone whose policy was "Take as much time off as you want, whenever you want." That's not quite my policy, and in that position I found I worked rather a lot -- but I do encourage people to **be where you are**: When you're working, do it 100%, and then disconnect when you're not working. I find this results in far better productivity than if you're "always working" while trying to keep the rest of your life going at the same time.)

## Approval and tracking:
- I only ask that, if you want to plan to be away from lab and off work for more than a few hours during normal work days/hours, you contact me (David Mobley) before making concrete plans, just as you would any normal employer, to get approval. Normal employers expect folks to be available/reachable during working hours unless notice is given, and I have the same expectation.  Of course this does not apply to time off when the university is closed — though if you plan to be away over, say, Christmas it’s nice to know about your plans so I’m not asking you for things during that time.
- Once approved, please post in Slack #status when you will be away (and pin your post), as that’s where I’ll check for it.
- Please keep track of how much time you do take, to ensure you take adequate time off.

This is of course separate from any reporting you have to do for the university in connection with your position (e.g. postdocs have to handle timesheets, etc.)
