# Working in the Mobley Lab

I'm delighted you want to work in the lab. Research is exciting, and I take great pleasure from being able to learn new things, develop new tools, and help advance science. I'm glad you want to join us in this endeavor! 

Because working in a research lab is in some ways different from many other jobs, and because your relationship with me as an adviser is different from many other types of relationships, I want to provide some information on what you I expect from people in the lab, what you can expect from me, and how you can help me get you what you need to succeed. 

## A brief intro to research

Research, by its definition, is the process of discovering something new. Sometimes, this is a new discovery about nature, but it also may be a new way of doing something, a new way of thinking about things, or creation of a new tool to do something old better/differently/more efficiently. The point is, research involves the new. This makes it uniquely exciting and challenging. 

One way in which the "newness" of research is exciting and challenging is that it means that you're typically doing something that no one has done before, so no one can tell you exactly how to do it or what you will find. Sometimes, you may be following a well-established procedure and the novelty is in what you apply this procedure to and in your results. But other times, you're doing something entirely unique -- you're tackling your own unique problem, one which has not been yet solved by anyone else. If it had, you could just use their solution, rather than solving it yourself. This can involve lots of trial and error, backtracking and starting over, etc. I like to say that we put the "re" in research -- we search and then we search again.

It's important to realize this right away, because it means that you can't necessarily look up the right way to solve your problem, or how other people have solved it. Other people may have solved pieces of it, or related problems, but if someone else has already solved your problem, you normally shouldn't be doing it. 

Here, I strongly encourage you to read, "The Importance of Stupidity in Scientific Research," by Schwartz. This does a great job highlighting how research is fundamentally different from most other things we do. While not everything in this article applies to everything we do, you should definitely read it. You can get a PDF here: http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771.long

To quote Brian Shoichet, "Sometimes we learn the most from failure." Unexpected and/or wrong results often point the way forwards, once we understand them.

## My role as an adviser

If you're in my lab, I'm your research adviser. This is distinct from being your boss. It's important to dwell on the word "adviser" for a moment. At minimum, it means I provide advice. This fits within the context of research, as discussed above. Working in the group on a research project, you're working on a problem I have not already solved. If I had solved it, there would be no point in you also solving it (except perhaps as training or preparation to solve a harder problem). Thus, since I have not yet solved your problem, I can't tell you exactly how to solve it. I can offer advice -- I can explain how I would go about trying to solve it if I were doing so; I can point you to relevant literature or to other people to ask; I can tell you how I've handled similar problems, or pass on experience or conventional wisdom from myself or others. But fundamentally, I primarily provide advice. 

Sometimes, my advice may be very specific. If you're a new graduate student, or an undergraduate in the lab, I may tell you to try a specific approach first, perhaps applying a well-established technique to a new problem, and possibly I might even provide written instructions. You should do as I suggest. But you should still recognize that you're doing research, and so you need to understand the problem you're trying to solve, and see how my approach provides a route to solve that problem. If you just try to do exactly what I say without understanding it, problems and delays will almost inevitably result. (You will also grow frustrated when I ask you "Why are you doing that?" when you're just doing what I told you to do -- but I forgot WHY I told you to do it.) As you grow in your abilities and knowledge, you'll progress to more challenging projects where my guidance starts to sound a lot more like advice. And, if you're a graduate student or postdoc, I'm expecting you ultimately to develop to the point where you will occasionally (or often) think my advice is wrong, and be able to convince me that the way I suggest approaching a problem is in fact not the right way. This is a good thing -- our goal is to help you develop into an independent scientist, rather than an extension of my brain.

My role as an adviser is also to help you get where you want to go. You should make sure I know your career goals (see also the Individual Development Plans I'm now asking you to do), and talk with me about how your work in the lab can best help you accomplish those. If you're an undergraduate thinking of pursuing a professional degree in pharmacy, what you need from your time in the lab is going to look quite different than if you're a graduate student thinking of pursuing a faculty position, and so on. We should work through these issues together.

This also impacts what you need to learn in the lab. Depending on your goals and background, it may make sense for us to invest a good deal of time improving your presentation or writing skills, or giving you more opportunities to work as part of a team, or making sure you spend significant time teaching. My job includes working to help you develop in the areas you need to grow in. But to do so, I need to know your goals, and I need to know you want the help. For example, graduate students often need to improve their scientific writing abilities. You'll get some practice as you begin to write research papers. But if you feel particularly weak, or your native language isn't English, you may benefit from additional practice, so for some students in the past I've had them submit weekly written reports which I edit for English usage and return to them. But this is not normally something I impose on students -- I'll do it to help, if you want to develop in your writing abilities. 

Since I am your advisor, I need to know a good deal about what you're doing so I can offer good advice. But it also means that you have to be the expert about your project. 

### Let’s avoid a few misunderstandings about working in the group:

- Don’t treat me like your boss:
	- I’m not expecting you to blindly do whatever I say or whatever you think I want
	- If you blindly follow instructions, you’ll get into trouble because I’ll change my mind, or I won’t remember what I told you or why I told you to do it.
	- I want you to take ownership of what you’re doing; you should never find yourself telling me, "I did it because you told me to!" If you’re only doing it because I told you to, you haven’t taken ownership. You either need to get me to convince you it’s worth trying, or convince me that it’s not worth trying.
	- It’s your job to know your project, area, and field; the goal is that you get to know it better than me.
- Do treat me like your boss:
	- If you go off and ignore all instructions/suggestions/advice you receive from me, we won’t accomplish much together
	- If you’re not going to do what I suggest, then I need to know it and know why, so I can plan accordingly.
	- I’m not your problem-solver or tutor

Next, I want to address what I expect from people in the lab, which is mostly geared towards ensuring:
1. I have what I need to give you good advice and make sure we use our time productively
2. You know what you need to invest in order to succeed
3. You help me give you what you need to succeed

*Note: I said above I'm not your boss. But, I may also be your boss, if I am your formal supervisor (i.e. you're a paid researcher in the lab), but more of our interaction will come in the context of the advisor/advisee relationship.* 

## What I expect from you

- Meet with me when you need to talk - by coming by or (if it's a longer conversation) scheduling a time. 
	- Formerly I scheduled weekly meetings with each person in the lab, but this tended to result in times when I had too many meetings which were of the "nothing new to report" nature and not enough meetings with some people when things are busy.
	- Then I canceled all meetings and had everyone check-in electronically with me daily and met only when it was needed. This was bad for some people who needed meetings in order to feel like they had deadlines.
	- Currently we take sort of a hybrid approach:
	   - Everyone is encouraged to check in daily on Slack (see `#check-ins` channel) and answer, briefly (a sentence or less can suffice, unless more is needed):
       	   - "What did you do yesterday/last?"
       	   - "What are you going to do next?"
       	   - "Is anything blocking your progress/what would help you progress faster?"
   	   - We work to identify whether you do better with deadlines (regularly scheduled meetings with me, e.g. weekly) or more independence
   	   - We schedule meetings accordingly
   	   - You know how to get my availability via Calendly so you can get me in the interim if needed (or drop into my office/office hours)
   	   - **Take initiative to set regular meetings with me on whatever frequency is needed**
- Come prepared when we meet, including bringing materials for: 
	- Updates on what you've done/ what challenges you're facing
	- Any new data/plots/ideas
	- Questions you need to ask; graphical aids to help with the discussion
	- Specific requests for any action you need from me
	- Come on time, or notify me in advance you will be late. 
- Give regular updates in your project’s Slack channel and via dailies and potentially also by keeping and sharing a detailed log of your progress. I want to be involved and know how you’re doing/how it’s progressing.
	- I can't help you if I don't know
	- If I don't hear from you, I often find it is a bad sign — I tend to assume you aren't doing anything, or you are stuck. If you're stuck, I need to know. And if you're not doing anything, I need to know it and know why. 
	- If you're working productively but independently on something, make sure I'm aware of it and why it's time-consuming; I can sometimes get impatient if I don't see progress unless I know what it is you ARE doing. 
- Take ownership. It's your project, and your future depends on it (see footnote below). You need to understand where we are, the goals, and how we propose to get there.  
	- If you don't understand why we're doing something, make it your business to understand
	- Don't wait for me to make it work.  
		- Press me for help when you need it
		- Get help from elsewhere
	- Often a project will tend to grow as time goes on. Part of your job is to fight against this so that you can finish it. 
		- Work to define clear objectives and endpoints
		- If the objectives expand, make sure they are still clear
	- You have responsibility to keep your project moving, focused, and organized.
	- You have responsibility to ensure it gets finished
		- You may need Dr. Mobley to nag other people to help you
		- You may need to nag Dr. Mobley to help you
		- You will likely need to set deadlines, milestones, etc., or work with Dr. Mobley to do so.
	- "Finished" means it turns into a paper or papers (or at least preprints) and a thesis chapter, usually
- **Know which projects are yours to own (see “take ownership”)**: 
	- Normally each project will have several people involved, but it “belongs” to one who will end up being the first author (though in some cases there may be co-first authors)
	- If the project is yours, you must take ownership of it, including nagging/setting deadlines
	- This is what earns your slot as first author and means you can use it in your thesis
	- If you don’t take ownership, someone else will have to, and they’ll get the first author slot
- **Be resourceful**, and don't reinvent the wheel: 
	- Read the manual
	- Use Google
	- Ask other people in the lab, or other nearby computational labs (Tobias, Luo, Andricioaei)
	- Find other people on campus with the expertise you need and ask them  
		- There are experts here on a huge variety of experimental and computational techniques
	- Ask users' lists for the software in question
	- If you're tackling a problem that surely, someone somewhere has solved before, decide whether it would be faster to find that person or to solve it yourself. Research is in the novel, not in reinventing the wheel. Ingenuity should be rewarded, but not wasted effort.
- **Keep track of what you've done**, using Evernote or Google Docs or similar
	- Record enough detail that if you find out something went wrong, you can see what you did
	- Record enough detail that if you need to do it again later (or show someone else), you'll know how
	- Record enough detail you can explain it in a paper
	- Keep files and other important information organized to deposit with your paper/thesis/etc. and for posterity (I need to update here with a link to recommended details to store)
	- Usually this means that you might spend as much as 1/4 of your time on a given project organizing data, taking notes, etc. This ongoing organization will save you a lot of time when you go to write a paper and organize your data.
- **Make good use of my time**: Recognize I don't have infinite time, so make good use of the time I can give you
	- Make every effort to remember what we discuss, even if it means taking notes or asking me to slow down or repeat something
	- Understand what I tell you, even if it means making me clarify
	- Slack is great. But know when NOT to use it; other technologies (such as in-person conversation) can have much better bandwidth.
- **Treat research as a job or more** (see footnote): 
	- Set aside time to be focused on research and do it; if you're a full-time researcher, invest full-time (at least 40 hrs a week) in research. (Many people are excited about it and do more than that -- but at minimum you should give it your full attention for at least that amount of time).
	- Give it your absolute best effort and brainpower
	- In general, be physically present in the lab much of the time
		- You may need to ask questions of others or they may need to ask you
		- These may be relationships you have the rest of your career
		- If you’re more productive elsewhere, make sure I know that.
	- The “10,000 hour rule” says that it takes roughly 10,000 hours of practice on average to become an expert at something. Your goal in graduate school is to become an expert in your area. 10,000 hours works out to roughly 50 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, for four years, or 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, for five years. (I am not recommending 50 hour weeks, just doing math.) This is not a firm guide; the point is to recognize it takes a significant investment of time and energy.
- **Ask for help when you need it**, and let me know when you're stuck
- **Know the relevant literature**, keep up with new innovations in the area as well as background information and historical context. Use the group `#journalclub` Slack channel to help with this.
- **Meet due dates**; if I ask for something specific and don't tell you when I need it, ask.
- **Be an adult**
	- Have a calendar. Use it. Don’t miss meetings or scheduled events without advance notice or because you forgot to calendar them.
		- Block out time on your calendar to do your most important work at your best times
		- Don’t set your priorities based on what happened most recently or what seems most urgent; make sure to get to your most important work
	- Have a to-do list (whatever technology works best for you; many of us like Todoist). Use it.
		- Block out time to do the most important things
	- Back up your data. Assume you will have multiple critical hard drive failures during your graduate career. Plan for it.
	- Use secure passwords, and probably a password manager (LastPass and 1Password are good options, but there are others). Check out http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net and the XKCD linked there.
	- Plan reasonable vacations. You’ll need to recharge once in a while. Perhaps 2-4 weeks a year of time off is reasonable; run it by me first before making plans.
- **Develop your writing skills**. Many scientists are weak in this area, but you’ll have to do a lot of it. Work at it.
	- Read Plaxco’s “The art of writing science”
	- Read the [lab style guide](https://github.com/MobleyLab/Training/blob/main/Writing/StyleGuide.md)
	- Plan your writing time. Writing a paper draft should take no more than a month.
		- Scott Shell points out that a typical paper is about 7000 words; if you write four hours a day for two weeks that’s an average of 150 words per hour or 2.3 words per minute, which is nothing compared to writing a paper in a night for a college class. So it should never take multiple months to write a draft, unless you’re wasting a ton of time somewhere. I’m happy to help if you find that’s the case.
- **Remember how to do things when shown**
	- If I show you how to do something, I probably will expect you to be able to do it again (or to teach someone else how). Take notes as needed to make this happen, or ask me to watch while you do it yourself, or both.
- **Use group funds wisely, with permission**
	- Don’t book travel for the group without discussing it with me
	- Usual rule of thumb: You can go to some workshops/conferences/major meetings once you have work for publication/presentation; usually this will involve sharing an inexpensive hotel with another group member
	- Find out about travel reimbursement policies first
- **Seek funding**
	- Note #funding Slack channel, with corresponding Google Doc
	- Usual rule of thumb: Even if I have adequate grants, you will TA at least once a year unless you have your own funding
- **Back up your data**
- Be familiar with, and occasionally recap, the material on the New Member Checklist

Footnotes:
- *The degree to which this is true progresses as your career does; it's much more true for postdocs than graduate students, and more true for graduate students than undergraduates.*
- *Undergraduates or students taking a heavy class load are a bit of an exception with respect to treating research as more than a job.*

## What to expect from me

- Available to you on a regular basis 
	- I should be available to meet at least weekly or more when needed (except when traveling); I'll also be reading your daily check-ins via Slack
	- If you need regularly scheduled meetings we can meet at the frequency we decide makes the most sense
- Help with project selection and planning
- Help figuring out how to do your project, advice on how to proceed, suggestions on how to get un-stuck, evaluations of your results
- Pointers on where to get help or additional information
- Mentoring as you want or need it -- for example, on presentation skills, writing, collaboration, etc. Ask.
- Assistance preparing, editing, and submitting papers 
	- If you have trouble writing, I'm also happy to block out a big block of time and sit down and work through a rough first draft together (i.e. on a Saturday afternoon, …) 
	- But you also need to plan ahead (see “How to help me help you…”); you have to book time if you need me to edit a draft or similar. 
- Training in what you need to know 
	- From me, the group, or somewhere/someone else
- Help with networking and connections
- Help getting funding if applicable
- I will have things done when I say I will (or if not, I may need a reminder)
	- Caveat: Paper-editing. If I book time to edit your paper but find it is full of grammar errors, I may exhaust my editing time trying to fix your grammar errors. You don’t want this. Get other eyes on it first.
- I’ll assign you a chore of some kind; usually everyone gets one (website duties, watching funding opportunities, coordinating group meeting, etc.). This is partly to make sure I have time to do things like edit your papers and meet with you, rather than spending all my time doing logistics.

If you're in the lab, feel free to drop by my office unscheduled, but do ask if I have time. 

## How to help me help you

I juggle a lot of responsibilities, and so as a result am normally a bit backlogged on things. I try to prioritize the things you can expect from me (above), with research coming near the top of the list. (If you want to understand a bit more about the demands on faculty’s time, this [document from colleague Scott Shell is a useful read](https://shellresearchgroup.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/grad_student_lowdown.pdf). 

In any case, given that I have limited time, there are a number of ways you can help me do a better job getting you what you need:

- Remember I'm your adviser, and you're the expert on your project. This means I can't remember every detail, so you need to remind me. A good starting point is to assume that I don’t remember what you’re doing and why you’re doing it any time you give an update, so to provide a bit of context (or a link to a log!).
	- I may not remember the advice I gave you, or why I gave it to you -- so remember it or keep track of it. 
	- Understand what I recommend and why: (a) If you think of a better way, you'll know it's better. (b) You can explain it to me when I forget. 
- I normally won't remember to do anything unless I have it written down 
	- If you don't see me write it down, remind me
	- If you think I might have forgotten about it or lost it, ask
	- If you have a list of things you need from me, make a checklist for me on GitHub, in Todoist, or in Evernote.
	- If you need something and it takes me more than a week (unless I'm on travel/vacation) and I haven't mentioned it, ask. Normally if I'm going to be slow about something, I'll tell you (and apologize).
	- If you have a deadline for something you need from me, make sure I know it. And I’ll tell you when I’ve done things, so if the deadline is approaching and you haven’t heard, remind me. (Note: I tend to never complete tasks without deadlines.)
- You can help me by writing things down for me (i.e. if you need something, mention it in Slack and in a project document)
- Keep good project notes showing your progress and what you're doing next, and share them with me 
- When you need help, make sure I have what I need to help you right in front of me by providing it all at once, such as: 
	- A brief reminder of what you are trying to do and why (and perhaps also link to a project document)
	- Exactly what went wrong, at what stage
	- All commands, input files, paths, etc., to reproduce your problem 
	- What I need to know to repeat your exact procedure to troubleshoot 
	- If it will expedite, ask to sit down together to look at it 
- I am forgetful and will contradict myself, giving you opposite advice at times. I apologize for this. On the plus side, it means you'll have to think through things from both sides.
- If you are unable to make progress on something without something from me, make sure I know (and remind me)
	- I don't like to keep people waiting, especially if there is nothing else they can do in the meantime
	- But I may not always know/remember you're in that situation, so if you are, let me know.
- I try to use e-mail sparingly and Slack more, but if you need something urgently, call me or text me. I deliberately check e-mail infrequently. Assume e-mail response times will be at least a day, often longer. (If something in e-mail is urgent, tell me about it in another way.) 
- Don’t e-mail me stuff when it could go in Slack. But if you need to e-mail, use e-mail subject lines that describe the content and action needed, as well as the timeline
- Don't embed an important new e-mail topic in an old thread unless you want me to miss it. I tend to archive e-mails perhaps excessively, especially if I think they’re about an issue I’ve already dealt with.
- Book time for what you need.
	- My schedule can become completely booked. If you are planning to have me a paper draft to edit, or code to review, let me know as far in advance as possible in terms of your timeframe so I can actually get it on the calendar. Especially for things requiring good chunks of time, like paper editing, it can take me a couple weeks to get to it if you don’t give me advance notice. Make sure you have things ready so I can make the most of my time — you don’t want me to spend it fixing grammar errors or trying to find your input files to try out your code. Make it easy for me so you get the feedback you want.
