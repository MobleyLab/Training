# Specific Advice for Graduate Students and Postdocs in the Lab

## For graduate students specifically

### A bit on how our relationship will change over time

As a graduate student in the lab, you begin a great progression. At the beginning, the adviser has most of the knowledge and does the teaching, but ideally, by the end of the Ph.D., you have the most knowledge about your project and do the teaching. That is, our relationship should hopefully develop from one where I explain to you what I think should be done and why and you normally agree, to one where you explain to me what you think should be done and why, and I normally agree.  As far as I know, this progression is not one that you can deliberately work at -- but you can work at educating yourself, pouring yourself into knowing everything about your project(s) and how they connect to research being done elsewhere, and making sure you understand everything about what you are doing. As your knowledge and abilities grow, you will begin to have your own ideas and bring them to the table, and eventually, we will find that your ideas are right as often or more often than mine. Our goal together it to help you get to this point.

### Starting projects versus later projects

I often like to give graduate students starting in the lab one or two "warm-up" projects -- projects where I know how to do all or almost all of the work already, and I know the outcome will be interesting. In the process, you will get to learn how to use our technology (simulation packages, toolkits, etc.) and how to do the types of calculations we do, while at the same time achieving something interesting and publishable. As you do so, however, you should be engaged in the literature and we should be thinking about ideas for larger projects which will ultimately form the bulk of your dissertation.

### Internships
If you think you might be interested in doing a summer industry internship, either with a company working on drug discovery software, or in a drug company itself, keep me informed as I may become aware of opportunities. Several students have done internships at Schrodinger and OpenEye, but others, including Genentech, are also possible.

### What it Takes to Graduate
People often ask me how quickly they can finish graduate school, and what it takes to graduate. It's hard to give a firm answer to this since it depends to a large extent on things I don't control, including:
- You and how hard you work/how quickly you solve problems
- How well our science works out and how many problems we run into
Typically, people finish graduate school in our area in 4-6 years. UCI imposes a 9 quarter (3 year) clock for graduation after advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, though I understand exceptions are made. Beyond that, it's hard to be more specific. We're talking about research, and graduating involves completing one or more new research projects. If they had already been done, we could better predict how long it would take, but that also would mean they wouldn't amount to a Ph.D., which involves novelty. Often, though, most of the time in graduate school is taken up doing things that aren't exactly right or don't quite work out, which means that when things go well, it's possible to finish fairly quickly. For example, I graduated in four years, and in fact if I had to repeat all of my Ph.D. research after I knew what would work, I could probably have done it all in just six months, including writing my dissertation. Most of my time was spent doing things that didn't quite work out, or figuring out how to solve specific problems. 

Some advisers have firm guidelines as to what their students need to accomplish to get a Ph.D., such as a quota of first-author publications (three or five, for example). I don't have an absolute rule here, but I would expect that every graduating student will have at least one first-author publication on a project where they have been the primary driving force/taken ownership, and probably more (typically three or more). I don't want to rule out the possibility that a student might tackle one very large project which would be best suited for a single publication, but more often I expect students will either tackle three or more smaller projects, or one large project which also involves several innovations which are themselves suitable for separate publications. So, again, I have no firm rule here but you should normally plan on three or more first-author publications before you'll be able to graduate, unless there are special circumstances (e.g. we decide to put more work into a single larger publication, prioritizing doing new science over writing papers). When in doubt, talk to me about your specific situation.﻿


## For both graduate students and postdocs

### Presence in the lab

Pre-COVID, I would expect you to normally be physically present in the lab during normal working hours (i.e. roughly 8-9 hour days beginning sometime between 8-10 a.m. or so), unless you have arranged with me otherwise.  (There are obvious exceptions for classes, etc.) Post-COVID, this is still evolving and I am more receptive to remote work; at present, you should plan to have at least two days a week in the lab unless you've arranged with me otherwise, and one of those should be group meeting day. If you expect to be absent outside normal in-lab times, I would expect to hear in advance -- i.e., an e-mail in the morning when you wake up if you'll be out sick, etc. As noted previously ([Working in the Mobley Lab](WorkingInTheMobleyLab.md)) I expect you to treat graduate school as at least a full-time job. While I'm not particularly concerned about you clocking a specific number of hours, in general I find that people in the lab spend less time being stuck (because they can interact with me or lab mates), are able to help one another more, and make more rapid progress. 

Really, my major concern is with research progress -- if I know what you're doing, and you're working hard and making progress, and I can interact with you frequently, I'll not be particularly concerned about where you are. But if you never seem to be here and don't seem to be making any headway, I'll start to be concerned the two are linked and you're not putting in the time.

For postdocs, physical presence in the lab is particularly important, as postdocs are expected to be able to help other lab members, especially when my time is limited. 

### Having your own project ideas

It's good to have independent ideas for projects, digressions, or papers. You ultimately should end up doing some projects of your own conception and design. But you also have to be prepared for me to ask you to drop things. To do a new project, you need to be able to sell me on it; if you can't, you'll have to make it a lower priority or drop it.

Project selection can be really tough. An ideal project would test an interesting hypothesis, and yield results which are important, interesting, and high-impact regardless of the outcome. Indeed, it's always working thinking through a project and figuring out what your next step would be if the outcome is A vs B. But sometimes, projects are interesting enough that it's worth doing them even if only one outcome is interesting. For example, with Chris Vanderwaal, I spent some time looking through known drugs to see if a new scaffold he had come up with had substantial shape similarity to the core of a known drug. If it did, he could potentially build a new drug targeting the same receptor based on his novel scaffold, which could potentially have very high impact. So we proceeded, though so far it looks like the outcome is that there are no such drugs. But if we found anything, it could have been tremendously important, so we were willing to tolerate the potential "uninteresting" outcome.

### Funding as it relates to project selection
If you have, or obtain, your own funding, this provides you with the most freedom in terms of selecting a research project, as it only needs to be something of mutual interest. In contrast, however, if you are supported by lab research funds, you will have to work on a project which those funds support, so this gives you considerably less freedom. 

### Funding and career advancement

Even if you are being supported in the laboratory by my research funds, you are strongly encouraged to seek your own funding. One reason for this is that in the sciences, success at obtaining funding is often taken as a mark of a successful researcher. So, whether or not you need the funding, future employers will notice that you have obtained it. Additionally, many graduate and postdoctoral fellowships are fairly prestigious and/or known to be competitive, so these are taken as a further mark of success. It is a low-pressure, high-reward position: If you don't get it, it only cost you time and postage, but if you do get it, it's potentially a big boost to your career.

### Travel, conferences, and presentations
If you have work to present, or anticipate having work to present, consider presenting it either locally or at a conference. Look for opportunities which interest you, or talk to me about suitable opportunities. Don't let funding stop you from investigating. I may be able to fund your travel from my research funding, or you may obtain your own funding which provides for travel. Also, many conferences have special travel awards for students or postdocs. Becoming known in the scientific community is an important part of advancing your career (it is a remarkably small community), as is improving your presentation skills, which only happens with practice.  

### Plan for your future -- and have a backup plan

Think about what you want to do after you leave the lab, and investigate options as time goes on (for postdocs this is more urgent). Talk to me about what you think -- for example, if you're thinking academia, I want to talk with you about what it takes to get positions. If you're thinking industry, we should discuss steps to take so you know some potential employers. But do also think about backup plans -- what would you do if you can't do your first-choice? This should interface with our work on periodic Individual Development Plans (IDPs).
