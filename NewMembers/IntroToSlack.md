# Introduction to Slack in the Mobley Lab

## What is Slack?

Slack is essentially a group messaging application which can be accessed from multiple platforms: desktop application, web browser, and/or mobile application.

## Why do we use Slack?

- It cuts down on email a lot in a way which helps productivity:
    - Files / images / code snippets / hyperlinks are easily shared.
    - Communication is dynamic within channels or individual conversations or groups of conversations.
    - Conversations can be threaded, so multiple ideas can be concurrently discussed in an organized fashion.		
    - People coming in to a conversation late (or joining an old project) can easily see the history
- It organizes communication / information that is project specific.		
    - Channels can be created as desired for each project.
    - Individual names, or entire groups, can be tagged (e.g. `@channel`, `@dmobley`, `@gradstudents` etc.).
    - Past conversations (individual or inside channels) can be easily searched.
    - Important facts/data can be “pinned” in a channel or conversation for easy access.
    - Items can also be “starred” for personal reference.
- There are a number of useful features: setting reminders, integrating with calendars (e.g., Google Calendar) or task managers (e.g. Todoist), keeping up with journals (RSS feeds), keeping notes (by messaging yourself or Slackbot), etc. 	

## How to get started on Slack:

1. Dr. Mobley or another administrator will invite you to join team “MobleyLab”. The web interface can be accessed at mobleylab.slack.com.
2. Get the desktop application (mobile too, if you like; see below)
3. Browse through the available channels and join ones that pertain to you or that are interesting to you. Some channels all Mobley group members should take part in:		 				
    - `#general`: Group-wide announcements/stuff everyone should know		
    - `#groupmeetings`: Group event scheduling/discussion/reminders. Synchronized with group Google Calendar so it also issues event reminders, etc.
    - `#status`: This is for letting people know when you are/aren't available/where you are, etc. If you’re planning a trip/vacation, note it here and pin it. (Also update your status description when you're leaving!)
    - `#journalclub`: Perpetual Journal Club - post links to interesting articles here, or comments on articles you are reading, etc.	If you have an upcoming group meeting and it’s not good timing to do a research update, pick a hot paper from this (or elsewhere) to present on!
    - `#announcements`: Announcements which are e-mailed in (this channel has an e-mail address); seminar announcements, etc. If you get an email that you would like to share with the group (e.g., funding opportunities, upcoming seminars), forward that email to the e-mail address listed in the channel details (click the down arrow from the channel name in the desktop app) and it’ll come straight to Slack.

    - Some optional channels you might be interested in:		 				
        - `#computing`: Computing environment, high performance computing, cluster operations, etc.		
        - `#coding`: General coding and software (i.e. GitHub) questions/comments/info 	
        - `#purchasing`: Purchasing of things for the lab/otherwise.
        - `#refrigerator`: Group fridge management/notices.		
        - `#random`: Non-work banter and water cooler conversation. Or puns. Definitely puns.
        - `#outreach`: Volunteer activities with UCI and the local community.
        - `#writing`: Tips/info on writing scientific papers, etc.
        - `#funding`: Funding opportunities
        - `#journal_(whatever)`: Journal RSS feeds. Subscribe to these if you want to see what’s in that journal.
        - `#website`: Group website maintenance/discussion
        - `#mobleylabevents`: Channel for event planning (ie lab trips, holiday celebrations, etc.)

4. Add a distinct logo/avatar for yourself. This will make group conversations easier to follow. Some find these especially helpful.

5. Plan check-ins. Pick a channel to do regular (daily or weekly, depending on how research active you are) check-ins on what you're doing. Answer these three questions; even single-sentence or single-phrase answers will work:
   1. What did you do yesterday/last?
   2. What are you doing next?
   3. Is anything blocking your progress/what would help you make better progress?


## Slack etiquette:

- **Mind what notifications you send:** A message usually triggers a notification, especially if you @ mention the person. Don’t send notifications except to get attention. For example:
    - If someone asks you to do something but doesn’t ask for a response, just use :eyes: to show you saw it (see “emojis”, below)
    - Make sure anyone you @ mention really needs a notification
- **Keep science open**: Keep as much as possible in open channels rather than direct messages or Howdy check-ins
    - If someone joins a project later, you want the things they should know to be in a channel they can join
    - Save direct messages for things which should be private
- **Set your status**: If you’re away (e.g., in a meeting, at lunch), you can set your status (with emoji optionally!) to let others know replies may be delayed.
- **Know when NOT to use Slack**: Verbal communication (including with drawings!) can be much faster/higher bandwidth. Know when to switch technologies.
    - Ask to switch to voice/video
    - Ask to schedule a meeting
    - Slack is good for short/brief updates, asynchronous communication, etc. Don’t stretch it to cover what it shouldn’t.

##Bonus points for Slack:##

- **Lots of emojis!** You can "react" to any message. E.g. a common reaction is "thumbs up".
    - Tip: If someone asks you to do something, use the "eyes on" ( :eyes:) emoji to show that you saw it. Then when you've done it, use the :white_check_mark: to show it’s done and taken care of. Note that you can also search for these emoji's, so you can use them to flag things you're supposed to do/have done and search for them...
- **Different levels of notifications!** You get a direct (!) notification for individual messages and for @ mentions. For channels that people are updating, it shows up as bold. If you don't belong to a channel, you don't get those notifications.
    - **Be sure to adjust your notification settings** -- many people will find it too distracting to have Slack “ding” at you for everything. If you have the app on your computer, click on “Slack” in the upper left corner and click “Preferences” to change things like notifications or sidebar settings. You will also see an option for uploading emails to slack under “Messages & media”.
    - Fine-grained notification control allows you to make certain channels be low priority or silent, others make noise, and others (such as direct messages or mentions of your name or key words) be especially obvious.
- **Apps!** You can check Slack on your phone and get notifications and respond rapidly.
- **Permalinks!** Every post has a permanent link (URL, effectively) that you can copy and re-use, such as to refer back to it in a later post, or to embed in your task manager (Todoist, for example) to pull it up when you need
- **Starred items!** When you want to easily be able to find something again, star it to make it easier to search for it or to pull it up when you toggle “show channel details” at the top
- **Pinned items!** The equivalent of starred items but for EVERYONE, not just for you. Attach a key document, note, or image to a channel long-term to make it easy to find until it’s un-pinned. Take responsibility for your project channel to pin key info there.
Examples of things that commonly get pinned: link to the code associated with some project, reference guides/etiquette on some computing cluster
If you will be away from the lab for sometime (e.g., going home for Christmas), note the dates you’ll be out and pin it to the #status channel.
- **Reminders!** Use /reminder to set reminders to yourself, everyone, or combinations of people.
Integrations! There are tons of integrations with other services you might want to use, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Todoist, etc.
- **Bots!** There are a variety of bots to perform simple tasks for you, i.e. run a simple poll by typing “/poll” and collect responses right in Slack.


## Other random info:
- Dr. Mobley tries to prioritize communication in Slack over e-mail, but adjusts notifications so not everything grabs his attention immediately. If you need to call his attention to something, direct message him, use `@dmobley`, or use the words “urgent” or “immediate” or similar.
- If you tell him something and he doesn’t respond or put :eyes: on it, remind him; on occasion he misses notifications, especially when in threads.
